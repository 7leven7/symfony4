# Autocomplete Js Tweaked Ending

Coming soon...

So I'll copy that role and in our admin utility controller above my method I'm going to add add is granted and we'll use that same thing. Now that is going to be a slight problem because in article admin controller, you can edit an article to edit the article. We're using this special security voter rule which actually allows non admins to edit articles if they are the author. So it's possible right now that you could be the author of an article and you actually won't be able to hit this Ajax end point. We're going to fix that later by actually disabling this field in the edit mode so that it needs to be set when it's created and that will be done by an admin. Then it will be modified later. So it's going to be an issue that will fix in the future.
