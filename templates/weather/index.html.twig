            <h2>Near Earth</h2>
            <p>So you're looking to visit Earth, that's great for you! The planet will be enjoying warmer than normal temperatures, so be sure to bring along your sunscreen. Temperatures outside of Earth today will peak at 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 Celcius).</p>
            <h2>Oort Cloud</h2>
            <p>Today we're experiencing breezier than normal weather out in the cloud. Which means that it will be a bumpier than usual ride if you're passing through. Prepare to set shields maximum to minimize damage and a trip to the repair shop.</p>
            <h2>Deep Space</h2>
            <p>There's no way to deny it. It is going to be very cold in deep space today. Be sure to pack your warmest coat, hat, mittens and boots. I would recommend minimizing your time outside of the ship today if possible. </p>
